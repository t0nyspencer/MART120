I’m not sure if you’re talking about the GUI or CLI within github because if you are then I am completely missing the agenda of this assignment. If youre just talking about in general I feel like GUI is so much more simple for anyone to use within computers and documents. BUT, with a CLI I feel like you would be able to be more specific about a certain task you want to be executed. That is my opinion I hope this meets the criteria. If you’re talking about a GUI and CLI in github then we need to have a conversation because I would be clueless to what you are talking about.
